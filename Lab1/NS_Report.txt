NS2: 
  For task 2 we ran a liveness test to ensure that both Alice and Bob
  reach their end state (pan executed with 'a' and 'f' flags). In other 
  words, we ensure that something "good" will eventually happen.

NS3:

  Trail sequence:

          1: Intruder sends msg1 to Bob with empty data
  2: Bob receives msg1 from Intruder
  3: Bob encounters a mismatch in keys and gets stuck

          4: Intruder sends msg1 to Alice with empty data
      5: Alice sends msg1 to Bob

  Explanation:

  What happens above is that Bob gets stuck at 3 since the key in the received
  message doesn't match Bobs public key and thus the process will block 
  forever. Intruder then sends a message to Alice. Since we have a
  rendezvous channel, Intruder will be unable to continue until someone
  receives its message. Finally, Alice also tries to send a message. At this
  point, all processess are blocked since Bob is stuck at his guard, Intruder
  is waiting for someone to receive his message (which no one will) and Alice
  is waiting for access to the channel so that she can sen her message.
